# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `requirements`

Downlaod Nodejs Installer:\

1. Visit the official [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)\
2. Download the Windows installer (.msi) for the LTS (Long Term Support) version.\

Install Node.js and npm:\

1. Run the downloaded .msi installer.\
2. Follow the prompts in the installer (accept the license agreement, select the destination folder, etc.).\
3. The installer will install both Node.js and npm.\

Verify Installation:\

- node -v
- npm -v

  These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.\

### `npm install`

Install all the required packages used in this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Note`

I've used mock data which is already rendering the data in the input boxes.
